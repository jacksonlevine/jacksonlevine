A falling sand simulation game written in C.

## [Mimodo](https://github.com/jacksonlevine/cameratest/tree/raycast)

An interesting game demo using raycasting.

## [Boris Lang](https://github.com/jacksonlevine/small-lambda-calc-interpreted-lang)

A simple interpreted language with a blend of Lisp and C-style syntax.

## [Multitrack Stems Player](https://github.com/jacksonlevine/multitrack-audio-player)

A backend and frontend framework to serve individual stems of songs, and play them together with "Solo" and "Mute" options for each track.
